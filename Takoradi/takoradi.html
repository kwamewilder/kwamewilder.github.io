          <h3>Takoradi Airport</h3>
          <p>During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command 
              Trans-Africa Ferry Route, was a major transportation link between the Atlantic 
              Ocean port of Lagos in Nigeria, and the Sudan. who is one of the main routes 
              for N.-Lease aircraft sent to Russia, and other supplies sent to British forces 
              in Egypt and the Middle East. 
              The route had been pioneered in 1936 by Imperial Airways, but was dramatically expanded during the war.

              Takoradi Airport was a major refueling stop between Monrovia-Roberts Field, Liberia 
              and Apapa Airport, Nigeria. Takoradi Airport was utilized as a Royal Air Force station 
              known as "RAF Takoradi", where crated aircraft, that had been shipped over the Atlantic,
              were assembled prior to being flown to operational areas in North Africa. 26 Squadron 
              SAAF was also based in Takoradi during WWII flying Vickers Wellington bombers on 
              anti-submarine and convoy protection patrols over the Atlantic. A number of South African 
              Air Force airmen are buried in the Takoradi European Public cemetery adjoining the Airport.

          <h3>Fort Orange</h3>
          <p>Originally a Dutch fortress, Fort Orange is located a few metres off Sekondi’s harbour 
            in the Western Region. Though it served as a trading post for some time, Fort Orange 
            was originally intended to be as a lodge, and it served that purpose during the 1670s. 
            The 1670s were also years of intense European competition for the wealth of the Gold Coast, 
            and to weaken the Dutch stronghold on the coast, the English built a succession of forts and 
            lodges within gunning range of Dutch fortresses. After this lodge was attacked by the indigenous people - 
            for instance, when it was attacked by the Ahtantas in September 1694 - it was reconstructed into a much 
            more fortified fort by 1704. Unsurprisingly, the fort’s cannons were mainly directed at the nearby British trading lodge.

            Since its cessation to the British in 1872, ‘Fort Oranje’, as it was called by the Dutch, has been used as a lighthouse. 
            Fort Orange is now a naval base for the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority.

          <h3>Takoradi Habour</h3>
          <p> The Takoradi harbour is 230 kilometres from Accra, the capital of Ghana. The port receives and exports high volumes of cargo.
             The management of the harbour is the responsibility of the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority. The harbour serves as the main 
             export port for Ghana. It handles 65% of total export with about 600 vessels visiting it. The harbour also serves the international 
             trade purposes of land locked countries in the Sahel region of Africa. Some of the countries are Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The 
             harbour transits large volumes of cargo for these countries. The harbour handles 37% Ghana's seabourn traffic and 62% of national exports. 
             It receives 20% all the imports that the country receives.
