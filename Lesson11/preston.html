                <p>Preston, city and nonmetropolitan district, administrative and historic county of Lancashire, northwestern England. 
                    It is located at the lowest bridging point of the River Ribble estuary before it flows into the Irish Sea. 
                    Preston Cenotaph The Preston Cenotaph, a memorial to soldiers from Preston who were killed in World War I, in Market Square, Preston, Lancashire, England. 
                    Andrew Gritt (CC BY-SA 2.0)The town of Preston grew near the site of a Roman fort at Walton-le-Dale, on a ridge overlooking the river. 
                    The name Preston is derived from Priests Town, suggesting early settlement of religious origin dating back to the Anglo-Saxon period. 
                    By the 1086 Domesday survey, Preston had become an important market town and administrative centre. 
                    Its Market Place still occupies the same location some 1,000 years later. In 1179 Prestons first Royal Charter was granted. 
                    By the 1500s Preston was a centre of the woolen and linen trade. 
                    Much of the medieval street plan and main commercial streets of Church Street, Fishergate, and Friargate are still in use today. 
                    While many older commercial buildings stand on original medieval building plots, the Victorians added the Covered Market, Market Street, Orchard Street, and Miller Arcade. 
                    The picturesque Georgian town was transformed by the Industrial Revolution, bringing mills, engineering works, housing, canals, and railways. 
                    The River Ribble enabled Preston to become a trading port from the mid-14th century, with that growth leading to its development of an 18th-century quay and large inland dock in the 19th century. 
                    When anti-Catholic laws were repealed in the 18th century, Preston quickly became the predominant Catholic town in northwestern England, and St. 
                    Walburges Catholic church, has one of the tallest spires in the country.In 1777 the first cotton-spinning mill was built in Moor Lane. 
                    By 1835 there were 40 factories, mainly spinning, producing 70,000 pounds (32,000 kg) of cotton yarn weekly. 
                    Cotton was the principal employer for more than 150 years, and famous names such as Horrockses took their cotton cloth all around the world. 
                    <br>
                    Preston is also where the inventors Richard Arkwright and John Kay developed the water frame textile spinning machine.

                    Subscribe NowDuring the English Civil Wars (1642–51), Preston, the Lancashire Royalist headquarters, was besieged and captured, and the fortifications were destroyed. 
                    Royalist forces were defeated by the Parliamentary forces of Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Preston at Walton Bridge in August 1648. 
                    The last battle of the Jacobite rebellion, the attempt to reinstate the line of James II, also was fought in Preston, at Market Place, in 1745. 
                    Charles Dickenss experiences in Preston during another of the citys pivotal historical moments, the lockout and strike of 1853–54, inspired his novel Hard Times (1854). 
                    <br>
                    The woman suffrage movement also has important links to Preston, primarily through the activism of leading suffragette Edith Rigby. 
                    Other famous Prestonians include temperance advocate Joseph Livesey and autodidact and astronomer Moses Holden, who played pivotal roles in the founding 
                    of the Preston Institute for the Diffusion of Knowledge (1828), where working men and women could borrow books and attend classes. 
                    The Harris Institute, which took on the pioneering work of the Institute for the Diffusion of Knowledge, eventually became the University of Central Lancashire. 
                    The Harris Museum, Art Gallery and Library, established by the trustees of E.R. Harris in 1879, contains several personal book collections.

                    Preston City Council is the political descendant of the old Preston Corporation and Guild Council, which ran the affairs of the town from the first Royal Charter in 1179. 
                    Today Preston remains a regional capital and is home to the highest court in Lancashire, the Crown Court. 
                    Its oldest court building is now occupied by the Museum of Lancashire. The Fulwood Barracks, once home to the 47th and 81st regiments of the British army, houses the Lancashire Infantry Museum. 
                    Preston boasts some of the oldest parks and open spaces in the region, notably Avenham and Miller parks. Winckley Square, centred on open gardens, is the site of notable Georgian architecture and 
                    lies at the heart of the city centre. Also of architectural significance is the Preston Bus Station, an example of New Brutalist design.Area borough 55 square miles (142 square km).
